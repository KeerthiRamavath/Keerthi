<p> It was really a very good experience.At first I got stucked in many areas but now I am good at it.It was really a wonderful experience. BY doing this project I learned HTML and CSS .Now I am able to create my own page using CSS.It was really a very good experience.Previously I did not know much about HTML and CSS but now i knew very well about them only because of this project.I am feeling glad that I succesfully done my project.I thank our respected lecturer for giving such interesting projects.I have done many projects since childhood but creating web page is for the first time .So i feel pretty much exicted in doing this.it was great. </p>
